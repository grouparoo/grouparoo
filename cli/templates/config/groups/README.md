# Groups Code Configuration

This directory is where you will put configuration files for the Groups you add to your Grouparoo application. If you use [the `generate` command](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/cli/config#generate) to build these files, they will be placed here automatically.

See our [Groups Code Config Guide](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config/groups/community) for more information on generating Group config files.
