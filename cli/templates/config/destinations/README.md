# Destinations Code Configuration

This directory is where you will put configuration files for the Destinations you add to your Grouparoo application. If you use [the `generate` command](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/cli/config#generate) to build these files, they will be placed here automatically.

See our [Destinations Code Config Guide](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/config/destinations/community) for more information on generating Destination config files.
