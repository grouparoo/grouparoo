# Running a Grouparoo Application

> This is an abbreviated version of the "Grouparoo Deployment Guide". [The full version can be found here](https://www.grouparoo.com/docs/deployment).

## Deploy to Heroku

The simplest way to see Grouparoo in action is to deploy it to Heroku for free:

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/grouparoo/app-example)

## Run locally with Docker & Docker Compose

Assuming you have Docker installed:

```bash
# in a new directory
curl -L https://www.grouparoo.com/docker-compose --output docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up
```

## Run Locally with Node.js

Use the Grouparoo Generator to bootstrap a new Grouparoo Project:

```bash
npx grouparoo generate
# configure postgres and redis, you can modify `.env` as needed
npm start
```

This will generate a `package.json` and `.env` file for configuration.

## Populating Demo Data

Use the `staging-public` app to try things out.

```bash
cd apps/staging-public
# populate the system with 1000 profiles, properties, 1000 purchases, groups, and some events
(npx) grouparoo demo-data-purchases

# including the --scale param allows you to control how many profiles you make. e.g. --scale 10 makes 10,000 extra profiles.
(npx) grouparoo demo-data-purchases --scale 10

# populate the system with events
(npx) grouparoo demo-event-stream
```
