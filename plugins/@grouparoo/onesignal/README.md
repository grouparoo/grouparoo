## Groups

Groups are sent to OneSignal as tags on players.
`In ` will be prepended to the configured group name to represent group membership.

**Example:** If the player is in the group `High Value Customers`, the tag `In High Value Customers` will be set to `1` on OneSignal.

For customers that are not in the group, the attribute will not be set.
