## Groups
Groups are sent to Customer.io as attributes on customers. 
`In ` will be prepended to the configured group name to represent group membership.

**Example:** If the customer is in the group `High Value Customers`, the attribute `In High Value Customers` will be set to `true` in Customer.io.

For customers that are not in the group, the attribute will not be set.
