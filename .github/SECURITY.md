# Grouparoo Security Disclosures

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability with any Grouparoo product, or a library we rely on, please email help@grouparoo.com. Do not post the vulnerability to a public forum, like Github Issues.

To help monitor for security issues and disclosures, we employ automated dependency monitoring via:

- [Github Vulnerability Alerts](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-security-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies)
- [Dependabot Monitoring](https://dependabot.com/)
