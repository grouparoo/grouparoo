# Add an App

Apps are how Grouparoo can connect to any number of different tools such as your databases, data warehouses, and other 3rd party tools.

You can add an app either from the dashboard or from the left-navigation.

When you're first getting started, we recommend adding the App that has the majority of your customer data such as a data warehouse or production database replica. Once you've chosen an App, add the connection details you'll need to connect to this App.

As you add more tools to your stack, you'll want to add new Apps first before you add Sources or Destinations.

# Next Steps

- [Creating a Source](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/blob/master/documents/guides/create-sources.md) to pull Customer data into Grouparoo
- [Creating a Destination](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/blob/master/documents/guides/create-destinations.md) to send Profiles and Groups to 3rd party tools
