# Sending to Destinations

Now that you've defined Profiles, Profile Properties, and Groups, you can now send your Customer Data to [Destinations](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/blob/master/documents/product/concepts.md#destinations). Destinations are tools where you want to send your Customer Data so you can take action on your workflows. These Destinations can be Email Marketing tools like Marketo, Sendgrid, or Braze. Destinations can also be data tools like Redshift or Snowflake.

To start, you will need to

## 1. Add an App

See our [guide](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/blob/master/documents/guides/add-apps.md#destinations) on how to add an app.

## 2. Create a Destination

Once you've added the App, you can create a Destination. Click on `Destinations` in the left-nav and then click `Add new Destination`.

Select the type of App where you want to send Customer Data.

Once you've selected the type of App, the specific questions and settings will vary. Here is Mailchimp, as an example. Mailchimp has Audiences that each have a `listId`. You can choose the specific `listId` you'll want to set for this Destination.

Now you can define what Groups and what Profile Properties you want to send to your Destination. You can choose to send `All Groups` or a specific Group to send.

Next you can choose which Profile Properties you want to send to your Destination. Usually a Unique Profile Property will be required so the Destination knows how to identify and keep profiles separate.

Lastly, you can choose how Group membership shows up in your destination. This mapping is different from the choice above. The choice above defines which Profiles, or **Who** gets sent to the Destination. This mapping lets you decide how Groups are represented in your Destination.

Now that you're done, your Profiles, Profile Properties, and Groups are all synchronized in real-time across your Sources and Destinations. As your customers take actions, Grouparoo will automatically detect changes in your Sources, update Profiles and Groups, and send them to your Destinations.
