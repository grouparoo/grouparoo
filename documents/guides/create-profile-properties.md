# Create a Profile Property

Now that you have a Source or some Sources ([how to add a Source](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/blob/master/documents/guides/create-sources.md)), you can start to define Profile Properties. [Profile Properties](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/blob/master/documents/guides/create-sources.md) are data values associated to the Profiles you have in Grouparoo.

Multiple Profile Properties can be defined from the same Source. You can create new Profile Properties from the Profile Properties list:

You can also create new Profile Properties by going to a Source's detail page.

There are a number of options for how you can define Profile Properties such as whether it is `unique`, whether the property is an `array`, and as well as the aggregation method.
