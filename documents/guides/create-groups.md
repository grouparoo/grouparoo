# Creating Groups

Now that you've created Profiles and Profile Properties, the next step is to create Groups. Groups are a segment or cohort of Profiles. You can have `Calculated Groups` and `Manual Groups`.

## Calculated Groups

`Calculated Groups` add and remove Profiles automatically based on Group Rules that you define. Here are a few different examples of `Calculated Groups` and their rules:

### Example: Repeat Purchasers

Group Rules:

- Profiles who have purchased more than once
- Profiles with an email

### Example: High-Value & Abandoned Cart Recently

Group Rules:

- Profiles who have a Life-time Value (LTV) of over 30
- Profiles who have recently added an item to their cart
- Profiles with an email

### Example: High-Value Xhosa Speakers

Group Rules:

- Profiles with a language set to `xhosa`
- Profiles who have a Life-time Value (LTV) of over 50

## Manual Groups

While a great deal of the value of Grouparoo comes from our `Calculated Groups`, `Manual Groups` are still valuable in certain circumstances. `Manual Groups` are Groups of profiles where you manually add or remove Profiles from the Group.
