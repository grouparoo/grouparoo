# Creating Groups

Now that you've Profiles and Profile Properties, the next step is to create Groups. Groups are a segment or cohort of Profiles. You can have `Calculated` Groups and `Manual` Groups.

## Calculated Groups

`Calculated` Groups add and remove Profiles automatically based on rules or criteria that you define. Here are a few different examples of `Calculated` Groups and their rules:

### Example: Repeat Purchasers

Rules:

- Profiles who have purchased more than once
- Profiles with an email

### Example: High-Value & Abandoned Cart Recently

Rules:

- Profiles who have a Life-time Value (LTV) of over 30
- Profiles who have recently added an item to their cart
- Profiles with an email

### Example: High-Value Xhosa Speakers

Rules:

- Profiles with a language set to `xhosa`
- Profiles who have a Life-time Value (LTV) of over 50

## Manual Groups

While the power of Grouparoo lies in our `Calculated` Groups, `Manual` Groups are still valuable from time to time. `Manual Groups` are Groups of profiles where a Grouparoo user manually adds/remove Profiles from the group.
