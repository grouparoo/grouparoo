# Publishing Grouparoo

We use a combination of tools from `lerna` to handle publishing these packages.

- We automatically publish a new `alpha` release every night from the `master` branch.

  - This builds will be tagged `prerelease` and match the `alpha namespace`, ie: `v1.2.3-alpha.5` and have the npm tag `next` (ie `npm install grouparoo@core --next)`
  - The `lerna-changelog` tool will automatically read closed & merged pull requests between the previous tag and now to build the notes for the [Github release](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/releases)

- Automatically publish a new `latest` release every night if there are changes to the `stable` branch.
  - This builds will match the `normal namespace`, ie: `v1.2.3`. They will be `npm install`'d in the normal way.

CI uses a few secrets for authentication:

- `GITHUB_AUTH` - a Github PAT token. This is stored as an environment variable within Circle CI.
- `NPM_TOKEN` - a NPM access token. This is stored as an environment variable within Circle CI.
- A SSH key with write access to the `grouparoo/grouparoo` repo. This SSH key is only used for CI to checkout our repositories. CircleCI knows the private key and Github knows the public key.

As a note, we cannot `Include administrators` on Github's branch protection for the master or release branches as lerna needs to push it's changes back to the master branch after bumping the version and publishing.

Aside from the above, our staging servers are automatically deployed against any change to the master branch (which has all its tests passing).
