# Running a Grouparoo Application

## Getting Started

This guide will help you run the Grouparoo application on your local machine. Grouparoo is a node.js application written in Typescript.  Grouparoo relies on a Postgres database and Redis cache. Gropuaroo is distributed though NPM. 

### Step 1: Create your `package.json` file
Create a new project with a `package.json` file like the one below. Grouparoo is a [node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Make sure you are running node version 12 or higher. We use NPM to manage our dependencies. Grouparoo **requires** the **Postgres** and Redis databases. On OSX, these can be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```json:readme_deploy
{
  "author": "Grouparoo Inc <hello@grouparoo.com>",
  "name": "my-grouparoo-project",
  "description": "A Grouparoo Deployment",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "license": "UNLICENSED",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@grouparoo/core": "latest",
    "@grouparoo/mysql": "latest",
    "@grouparoo/postgres": "latest",
    "@grouparoo/mailchimp": "latest",
    "@grouparoo/csv": "latest"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "cd node_modules/@grouparoo/core && npm run prepare",
    "start": "cd node_modules/@grouparoo/core && ./api/bin/start",
    "dev": "cd node_modules/@grouparoo/core && ./api/bin/dev"
  },
  "grouparoo": {
    "plugins": [
      "@grouparoo/mysql",
      "@grouparoo/postgres",
      "@grouparoo/mailchimp",
      "@grouparoo/csv"
    ]
  }
}
```

This makes an "app" for Grouparoo to run. There is an example in the [staging-public](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/tree/master/apps/staging-public) directory.

There are some environment variables needed by Grouparoo that need to be set by your host/docker image. In development, we can also load these variables from a `.env` file that lives alongside your `package.json`.

### Step 2: Create your `.env` file
Create a copy of our [example](https://github.com/grouparoo/grouparoo/blob/master/apps/staging-public/.env.example) `.env` file to manage your environment variables locally. You can modify the options as needed. Make this as a peer to your `package.json` file. Note: the `.env` file only works when running in `NODE_ENV=development`. On your server, you should set up these same environment variables. At minimum, you will need to set the following variables:

```shell
PORT=3000
WEB_URL=http://localhost:3000
WEB_SERVER=true
SCHEDULER=true
WORKERS=1
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0"
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost:5432/grouparoo_development"
SERVER_TOKEN=a_random_token
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Run `npm install` to install dependencies. This will also run `npm prepare` which will compile the typescript application and build the web page components.

### Step 4: Start the Server
Run `npm start` to start the server and visit `http://localhost:3000` to get started. Follow the on-screen instructions to create your account and first team.

## Deployment Topology

Regardless of the method you deploy Grouparoo, the following topology will need to be created.

## Deploying to Production Environments

Now that you've tried Grouparoo locally, it's time to deploy it!
